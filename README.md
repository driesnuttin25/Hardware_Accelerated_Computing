## Image Convolution Accelerated on a GPU with CUDA

This project involves developing a CUDA-based application tailored for the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The primary objective is to efficiently process a sequence of 10 images, which can be sourced from predetermined URLs. Attention should be given to the dimensions of the images to ensure compatibility with the application's processing capabilities.

### Objective
The core functionality of the application centers around performing 2D convolution operations on the images. This process is aimed at demonstrating the profound impact of GPU acceleration on image processing tasks, leveraging the computational power of CUDA on the Jetson Nano.

### Demonstration
The following image shows the working of convolution and how it can make an image more blurry:
